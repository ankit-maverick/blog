A few months ago, I got this idea of working different jobs for short periods of time in different countries to experience different lives. For e.g.: Living a new job every month for a year like bartender, bus or a taxi driver, poker dealer, flight attendant, cruise attendant, hostel/hotel receptionist, teaching something etc. Why would I or anyone want to do this? If man dies with anything important, it is his experiences. We as a modern day human already live, cherish and enjoy various lives vicariously through books, movies, television and news, internet and social media etc. We enjoy the dark, complex or witty characters that we encounter in some Chuck Palahniuk novel or some TV shows like Breaking Bad. And attempting to live such lives, lives that are much different from what you have been doing all these years, even though for a short period like a month or two would be quite a new experience. It is like you can read and hear about a place in a distant country with different culture and watch videos on it but nothing can replace traveling and actually living there, not just living there but learning their local language, interacting and living with the local people, mingling with their culture and exploring their exotic landscapes. But since I am already talking about doing these different jobs in different countries with different ways of living, all the things that I just said about traveling are going to be a subset of the whole experience. There are of course some pre-requisites that cannot be ignored if one chooses to pursue this idea in action - knowing the local language fluent enough and having a work permit in that particular country and probably a few more that I am missing. I would definitely live like this for a year or two, don't know exactly when but soon.
