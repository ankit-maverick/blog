I want to live around the world by living in different coutries with extended periods of time that is at least 3 to 4 months at minimum. And the countries that I have in mind on top priority before others are Brazil, Russia, Columbia, Mexico, China. 

From the like-minded people whom I met during travel or I know travel, I have heard many great stories about living in these countries. 
The main reason for having these countries on top is that their way of living/culture is very different, exotic and personally appealing to me. And the more exotic a location, the more intense is the experience.
Having been exposed to western culture from the television, western media and movies, the western countries come last on my list.
